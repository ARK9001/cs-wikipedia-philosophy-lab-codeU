## learning goal 
Students can check whether nested structure is correctly balanced using a list to represent a stack.  Students understand how algorithmic analysis guides design decisions, and when other factors might be more important.

## notes
Take a look at parsing a super nested HTML doc. Notice that you don't actually need the LL version of ArrayList. Show that the problem domain really only needs standard Array implementation. Include the concept of thinking about your input data

If you are not familiar with the `Iterator` and `Iterable` interfaces, you can read about them [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) and [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html).
